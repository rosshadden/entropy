# Entropy

#### One selector engine to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.

Explanations and some examples can be found in the [official documentation](http://rosshadden.github.com/entropy/docs).
It is a long way off from all-inclusive, so feel free to ask me questions at ross@rhadden.com, [@darthlink44](https://twitter.com/darthlink44), or via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rosshadden/entropy/issues).

I drew inspiration for this from an [old experiment](https://github.com/rosshadden/engine-mmo) of mine, as well as from [sizzle](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle) and how much developers have come to depend on its usefulness.
